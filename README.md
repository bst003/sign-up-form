# Sign Up Form
TOP Sign Up Form

This project involves styling a basic web page with a 
sign up form, featuring basic html/javascript validation.

Throughout this project I used the 
max(), min() and clamp() CSS Functions in certain scenarios 
in order to create a more fluid and dynamic user interface.
